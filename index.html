        <p>Although we've been taking things day by day mostly, there are so many things for us to look forward to such as:</p>
        <button id="button2">Show More</button>
        <ul class="lookList">
            <li>5SOS OMG CAN YOU BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO SEE 5SOS?!?!?!</li>
            <li>We have the Chicago trip where I will get to meet basically all of your family and be able to see where you grew up and all the things you've been wanting to show me. Gosh and it's gonna be fall and the leaves are gonna be beautiful and the weather should be really nice. Hopefully there's good food there, we'll see...</li>
            <li>The Vegas trip is going to be a blast, seeing so many of the old rock bands that we all grew up listening to and also going out to eat some good food hopefully. The emerald cove and the hike when we get in should also be really nice at that time of year too</li>
            <h3>And this doesn't just extend to our vacations, but milestones for us such as:</h3>
            <li>Our 1 year anniversary is coming up</li>
            <li>Next year we are going to try to find a house together (and Mina)</li>
            <li>You getting a promotion and cultivating your professional expertice</li>
            <li>Hopefully me getting a nice programming job so you can eventually live like a queen by my side</li>
            <li>And most importantly for us to continue our individual development to become the best versions of ourselves that we possibly can be</li>
